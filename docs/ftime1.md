## Process 
Clicking **Reports** button in the _Master_ form will open the _Time Keeping_ form.

Clicking the **Search** button will open the _ItemSearch3_ form that can search and filter all employees and display their Name and ID in the **DataTable** in the _Time Keeping_ form. Selecting a row from the **DataTable** will display the employees `Name`,`ID`,`Position` and `Rate` in the **CutOff and Information** Groupbox and show the employee's DTR Information in the DTR Table depending on the `date` selected in the **CutOff and Information** Groupbox.
